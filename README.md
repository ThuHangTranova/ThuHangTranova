    <b>Welcome to my GitHub</b><br><br>
  
My first-ever experience with coding dates back to 2013 when I experimented with Tumblr HTML. At that time, I only aimed to create a visually appealing personal page showcasing my interests. While I thoroughly enjoyed designing my page, as a young teenager, the thought of pursuing coding professionally never crossed my mind. Consequently, it remained a sporadic hobby I indulged in during my free time. <br>
<br>
Fast forward to my university years, I encountered programming again, this time in the form of data analysis. It was during this period that I discovered my genuine interest in working with data—from data preparation to analysis, and particularly data visualization. I found immense satisfaction in transforming data into insightful and meaningful results. <br>
<br>
Driven by this newfound passion, I decided to complete two online programs focused on data analytics. The projects from both programs can be explored in my repositories. Feel free to take a look ◕⩊◕ <br>
